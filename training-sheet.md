# ðŸš€ HotWax Commerce Training Program

This training follows a **learn-by-doing** method. Instead of just reading theory, you'll work on building a real software solution for a sample brand called **NotNaked**, a direct-to-consumer fashion company. This helps you understand both the business side and the technical side of how software products are created and delivered to clients.

## The training is divided into three parts:

1. **Business Process** â€“ In this part, youâ€™ll learn how a retail company works in the real world â€” from taking customer orders to delivering products.
   By the end of this section, youâ€™ll have a clear understanding of the business journey of a retail company and how each step is tracked and supported by HotWax's product.

2. **Technical** â€“ This section equips you with technical skills to design data models, integrate business processes with technology, use platforms like OFBiz and Moqui, and write SQL â€” enabling you to build enterprise solutions.

3. **Business Process + Technical** â€“ In this section, you will set up HotWax's product on your local machine and understand its code along with the business service integrations.
