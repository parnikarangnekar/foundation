# Omnichannel Fulfillment Gamification System Documentation

## **1. Overview**

This document outlines the structure and components of the Omnichannel Fulfillment Gamification System. The primary objective of this system is to enhance the engagement and motivation of retail staff involved in omnichannel fulfillment processes. By introducing a gamified reward framework, similar to how fitness applications encourage activity, this system aims to make fulfillment tasks more enjoyable and incentivize performance.

## **2. Core Concepts**

The system is built around two primary functional areas:

Performance Tracking: This involves recording and aggregating data related to employee performance over specific time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly), potentially specific to a role they are performing.

Performance Recognition: This involves translating tracked performance into tangible recognitions or rewards, such as badges or acknowledgments. Recognitions can be system-generated based on performance reviews or issued manually.
