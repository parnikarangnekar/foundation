# **rejectOrderItems**
> NOTE: This REST API is used exclusively for rejecting OrderItems during the fulfillment processâ€”from an outstanding order up until just before the shipment is packed. Once the shipment is packed, items can no longer be rejected through this endpoint.

## **Overview**
The `rejectorderitems` REST API endpoint is used to reject one or more `OrderItems`. Internally, it builds a list of items to reject and calls `rejectOrderItem()` for each item. The actual rejection logic (including the cancellation of shipments, if needed) is handled by `rejectOrderItem()`. There is no separate `rejectShipmentItem` service.

Typical reasons for rejection include defective products, unavailable stock, or other conditions that require removing items from pending fulfillments.

## **Parameters for each OrderItem**

- **orderId**  
- **orderItemSeqId**  
- **productId**  
- **facilityId**  
- **rejectToFacilityId**  
  - Facility to which rejected items are transferred.
- **updateQOH**  
  - Flag indicating whether to update quantity on hand.
- **rejectionReasonId**  
  - Reason for the rejection (e.g., damage, mismatch).
- **maySplit**  
  - Defaults to **N**. When set to **Y**, only the specified order item is rejected (rather than the entire ship group).
- **cascadeRejectByProduct**  
  - Defaults to **N**. When set to **Y**, rejects all items in the specified facility that have the same `productId`.
- **rejectionReasonId**  
  - Reason for the rejection (e.g., `NOT_IN_STOCK`, `MISMATCH`, `REJ_RSN_DAMAGED`). Maps to a corresponding **`varianceReasonId`** in the inventory system.
- **comments**  
  - Free-text comments explaining the reason for rejection.

## **Output (OUT)**

- **List of Canceled Inventory Reservations**  
  Identifiers and details of any inventory reservations that were canceled due to this rejection.

## **Key Workflow**

1. **`rejectorderitems`** is called with a list of items to reject.  
2. It applies **`cascadeRejectByProduct`** and **`maySplit`** to determine which items to reject:  
   * **`cascadeRejectByProduct = Y`**: Include other items with the same product in that facility.  
   * **`maySplit = N`**: Reject entire ship groups rather than specific items.  
3. Based on **`maySplit`** and **`cascadeRejectByProduct`** values, the system queries order/shipment data:  
   * **`maySplit = Y`, `cascadeRejectByProduct = N`**: Reject only the single item.  
   * **`maySplit = N`, `cascadeRejectByProduct = N`**: Reject all items in the specified ship group.  
   * **`maySplit = Y`, `cascadeRejectByProduct = Y`**: Reject items with the same product ID, but only those specifically targeted or matching criteria.  
   * **`maySplit = N`, `cascadeRejectByProduct = Y`**: Reject entire ship groups for all orders containing the specified product.  
4. For each item to reject, **`rejectOrderItem()`** is called with the appropriate parameters.

## cascadeRejectByProduct = N

### 1. **maySplit = N and cascadeRejectByProduct = N**

```sql
SELECT oi.ORDER_ID,
       oi.ORDER_ITEM_SEQ_ID,
       oisg.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID,
       oi.PRODUCT_ID,
       oisg.FACILITY_ID,
       oi.STATUS_ID AS item_status,
       sh.STATUS_ID AS shipment_status,
       oi.CREATED_STAMP
FROM order_item oi
JOIN order_item_ship_group oisg 
     ON  oi.ORDER_ID = oisg.ORDER_ID
     AND oi.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID = oisg.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID
LEFT JOIN order_shipment os 
     ON  oi.order_id = os.order_id
LEFT JOIN shipment sh 
     ON  os.SHIPMENT_ID = sh.SHIPMENT_ID
WHERE oi.order_id = '4567'
  AND oisg.ship_group_seq_id = '0001';
```

#### **Explanation**

1. **No Cascading**  
   Does not look for items sharing the same `productId` (i.e., `cascadeRejectByProduct = N`).

2. **Reject Entire Ship Group**  
   Since `maySplit = N`, this query covers all items under the specified `orderId` and `ship_group_seq_id`.  
   - No `order_item_seq_id` filter is included.  
   - All items in `SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID = '0001'` will be targeted.

3. **Optional Shipment Joins**  
   Left joins to `order_shipment` and `shipment` retrieve any in-progress shipment status but do not affect filtering when `maySplit = N`.

### 2. **maySplit = Y and cascadeRejectByProduct = N**

```sql
SELECT oi.ORDER_ID,
       oi.ORDER_ITEM_SEQ_ID,
       oisg.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID,
       oi.PRODUCT_ID,
       oisg.FACILITY_ID,
       oi.STATUS_ID AS item_status,
       sh.STATUS_ID AS shipment_status,
       oi.CREATED_STAMP
FROM order_item oi
JOIN order_item_ship_group oisg 
     ON  oi.ORDER_ID = oisg.ORDER_ID
     AND oi.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID = oisg.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID
LEFT JOIN order_shipment os 
     ON  oi.order_id = os.order_id
LEFT JOIN shipment sh 
     ON  os.SHIPMENT_ID = sh.SHIPMENT_ID
WHERE oi.order_id = '4567'
  AND oisg.ship_group_seq_id = '0001'
  AND order_item_seq_id = '0001';
```

#### **Explanation**

1. **Reject Single Item**  
   With `maySplit = Y`, the query targets only the specified `order_item_seq_id = '0001'`.

2. **No Cascading**  
   `cascadeRejectByProduct = N` means only this exact item is considered, regardless of shared `productId` elsewhere.

3. **Ship Group-Specific**  
   `ship_group_seq_id = '0001'` restricts selection to items in that group. In combination with the single `order_item_seq_id`, it precisely identifies the specific item to reject.

## cascadeRejectByProduct = Y

#### **Common Joins**
- `order_item_ship_group (oisg)`  
  - Join on `ORDER_ID` and `SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID` to link `OrderItem` to its shipment group.
- `order_shipment (os)` (LEFT JOIN)  
  - Join on `ORDER_ID`. Some items might not have a shipment yet.
- `shipment (sh)` (LEFT JOIN)  
  - Join on `SHIPMENT_ID`. Some shipments might not exist or be fully linked yet.

### **Common Filter Conditions**
- `oisg.facility_id = '102'`  
  - Ensures we only select items from the specified facility (example uses ID `102`).
- `oi.status_id = 'ITEM_APPROVED'`  
  - Restricts to items that are approved.
- `sh.status_id IS NULL OR sh.status_id IN ('SHIPMENT_INPUT', 'SHIPMENT_APPROVED')`  
  - Ensures that items are in an in-progress shipment (not yet shipped).

### 3. maySplit = Y and cascadeRejectByProduct = Y
```sql
SELECT oi.ORDER_ID,
       oi.ORDER_ITEM_SEQ_ID,
       oisg.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID,
       oi.PRODUCT_ID,
       oisg.FACILITY_ID,
       oi.STATUS_ID AS item_status,
       sh.STATUS_ID AS shipment_status,
       oi.CREATED_STAMP
FROM   order_item oi
       JOIN order_item_ship_group oisg 
            ON  oi.ORDER_ID = oisg.ORDER_ID
            AND oi.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID = oisg.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID
       LEFT JOIN order_shipment os 
            ON  oi.order_id = os.order_id
       LEFT JOIN shipment sh 
            ON  os.SHIPMENT_ID = sh.SHIPMENT_ID
WHERE  oisg.facility_id = '102'
  AND  oi.status_id = 'ITEM_APPROVED'
  AND (sh.status_id IS NULL 
       OR sh.status_id IN ('SHIPMENT_INPUT','SHIPMENT_APPROVED'))
  AND  oi.product_id = '12888';
```
#### **Explanation**

1. This **directly filters** the result set to only include items where the product ID is `12888`.

```sql
 AND  oi.product_id = '12888'
 ```

2. This is helpful when you only want to **reject the specific item** that has `product_id = '12888'`, rather than affecting all items in orders that contain item `12888`.

### 4. maySplit = N and cascadeRejectByProduct = Y
```sql
SELECT oi.ORDER_ID,
       oi.ORDER_ITEM_SEQ_ID,
       oisg.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID,
       oi.PRODUCT_ID,
       oisg.FACILITY_ID,
       oi.STATUS_ID AS item_status,
       sh.STATUS_ID AS shipment_status,
       oi.CREATED_STAMP
FROM   order_item oi
       JOIN order_item_ship_group oisg 
            ON  oi.ORDER_ID = oisg.ORDER_ID
            AND oi.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID = oisg.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID
       LEFT JOIN order_shipment os 
            ON  oi.order_id = os.order_id
       LEFT JOIN shipment sh 
            ON  os.SHIPMENT_ID = sh.SHIPMENT_ID
WHERE  oisg.facility_id = '102'
  AND  oi.status_id = 'ITEM_APPROVED'
  AND (sh.status_id IS NULL 
       OR sh.status_id IN ('SHIPMENT_INPUT','SHIPMENT_APPROVED'))
  AND  oi.order_ID IN 
       (SELECT DISTINCT oi_inner.order_id
         FROM   order_item oi_inner
         JOIN   order_item_ship_group oisg_inner 
                ON  oi_inner.ORDER_ID = oisg_inner.ORDER_ID
                AND oi_inner.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID = oisg_inner.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID
         WHERE  oi_inner.PRODUCT_ID = '12888'
            AND oisg_inner.facility_id = '102'
            AND oi_inner.status_id = 'ITEM_APPROVED'
       );
```
#### **Explanation**

1. This query includes all order items in facility `102` with status `ITEM_APPROVED` and no shipment or an early-stage shipment (`SHIPMENT_INPUT` or `SHIPMENT_APPROVED`).

The **key condition** is:  
``` sql 
 oi.order\_ID IN   
    (SELECT DISTINCT oi_inner.order_id
         FROM   order_item oi_inner
         JOIN   order_item_ship_group oisg_inner 
                ON  oi_inner.ORDER_ID = oisg_inner.ORDER_ID
                AND oi_inner.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID = oisg_inner.SHIP_GROUP_SEQ_ID
         WHERE  oi_inner.PRODUCT_ID = '12888'
            AND oisg_inner.facility_id = '102'
            AND oi_inner.status_id = 'ITEM_APPROVED')
```
2.  This means we want **all orders** (and their items) **that contain a product with ID `12888`**. This is useful for a **cascade reject** because it affects all items within orders containing the specified productâ€”**not just the single item** tied directly to that product.

**Implementation Detail**:  
- The `rejectorderitems` endpoint receives the array above.  
- For each object in the array, it calls `rejectOrderItem()` with the relevant parameters (`orderId`, `orderItemSeqId`, etc.).  
- The `rejectOrderItem()` function then executes the appropriate logic (cascade or item-level), updates statuses, and cancels inventory reservations.
