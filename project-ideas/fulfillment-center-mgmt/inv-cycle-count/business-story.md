# Business Stories Leading to Cycle Counts

This document captures the **two primary business stories** that motivate and shape the cycle count process in retail operations. These scenarios form the foundation for our cycle count project.

## **Story 1: Annual Hard Count**

### Context
- At the end of the fiscal year, retailers must conduct a **full physical inventory count** to close their books accurately.
- This process is typically mandated by finance and audit requirements.

### Workflow
1. The **Head of Retail** schedules a count run for each store (`WorkEffort` of type `INVENTORY_COUNT_RUN`).
2. The **Store Manager** organizes the team to perform the count within a limited time window (e.g., Dec 31â€“Jan 2).
3. Each staff member is assigned a physical area (sales floor, backroom, etc.) to ensure coverage and avoid double counting.
4. Staff perform a full count of their assigned area, logging counts in `InventoryCountImport` and `InventoryCountImportItem`.
5. The Store Manager reviews all sessions, confirms accuracy, and submits results to HQ.

### Outcome
- Provides a complete snapshot of physical inventory across all stores at year-end.
- Enables reconciliation with book inventory for financial reporting.
- Establishes a baseline for future cycle counts and variances.

## **Story 2: Directed Cycle Count**

### Context
- Outside of year-end, **directed cycle counts** are performed to validate inventory accuracy in targeted situations.
- These are often triggered by operational signals such as:
  - Frequent rejections during order fulfillment.
  - High variance in stock movements (transfers, returns).
  - Products flagged as high-value or high-risk (e.g., shrinkage-prone).

### Workflow
1. HQ or the system schedules a **Directed Count** as a `WorkEffort`.
2. The **Store Manager** assigns staff to recount specific products or areas identified as problematic.
3. Staff perform a focused count of only those items/areas, recording counts in `InventoryCountImport` and `InventoryCountImportItem`.
4. Results are reviewed by the Store Manager and submitted to HQ.

### Outcome
- Improves inventory accuracy by addressing specific problem areas.
- Provides explainability for operational issues (e.g., why orders were rejected).
- Reduces shrinkage and improves trust in inventory data without requiring a full hard count.

## **Summary**
- **Annual Hard Counts**: Broad, mandatory, finance-driven events ensuring end-of-year accuracy.
- **Directed Cycle Counts**: Targeted, operationally driven checks that improve accuracy continuously.

Both stories complement each other: the hard count establishes a baseline, while directed counts maintain accuracy throughout the year.
