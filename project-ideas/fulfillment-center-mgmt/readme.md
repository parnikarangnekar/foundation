# Fulfillment Application Design Document

1. Fulfillment of sales orders (including basic picking and packing) and receiving of purchase orders
2. Inventory management including issuance and receipt, and inventory reservation for sales orders

## [Store Fulfillment Lifecycle](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/learn-hotwax-oms/business-process-models/store.fulfillment)


Order fulfillment is 3 step process,

### Step 1: 
The staff gets the list of Outstanding orders 
*   Search in "ORDER" solr document, look for 
  * facilityId, item approved, shipmentMethod, fulfillmentStatus is NULL


  * The user then starts the fulfillment process for set of orders by creating a [Fulfillment wave of orders](createOrderFulfillmentWave.md). A [PickList](../oms/createPickList) is returned for the user to go pick items for preparing the shipments.
     *  Background process: [Shipments](../oms/createShipment.md) are created for orders.
        - If the order item is a kit product, a distinct reservation will be created with the same order item for each product in the kit. When creating a picklist and shipment, all reservations will be included to ensure a proper fulfillment lifecycle.

Alternativley the user can choose to not proceed with picking and instead choose the following actions:

  *  The user can choose to [rejectOrderItems](rejectOrderItems.md) if for some reason orderItem cannot be fulfilled.
  *  The user can choose to [cancelOrderItem](cancelOrderItem.md) on request of the customer or Customer Service Rep (CSR).

### Step 2: 
User completes the [Packing](packShipment.md). Alternatively user can choose to edit autogenerated Shipment.
  *  [rejectShipmentItem](rejectShipmentItem.md).
  *  Add [ShipmentPackage](../oms/createShipmentPackage.md)
  *  Move ShipmentItems between packages.
  *  Activate gift card.
  *  After edits [packShipment](packShipment.md).
  *  [getShippingLabel](getShippingLabel.md).

### Step 3:
User marks Shipment shipped.
  * reprint shipping label and other documents
  * [voidShipmentLabel](voidShipmentLabel.md) and request it again.


## [Shipment lifecycle](../oms/ShipmentStatusWorkflow.md)
Shipment is created in SHIPMENT_INPUT, then SHIPMENT_APPROVED to SHIPMENT_PACKED and then SHIPMENT_SHIPPED

### [On SHIPMENT_APPROVED:](approveShipment.md)
* If the facility is part of the `AUTO_SHIPPING_LABEL` facility group. The service calls [getShippingLabel](getShippingLabel.md) from the logistics company.
  * On successful execution of shipping label RateShopping, update ShipmentRouteSegment. Set `shipmentMethodTypeId`, `carrierPartyId`, `actualCost`, `carrierServiceStatusId` (SHRSCS_CONFIRMED). 

* Once we have Shipping label, Shipment can be moved to SHIPMENT_PACKED status.
  * If `isTrackingRequired` is set to **N** in the ProductStoreShipmentMeth entity for the given Shipment Method, then the user can pack the shipment without a shipping label or tracking code.

### On SHIPMENT_PACKED:
* Ship (Handover in case of BOPIS) the Shipment moves Shipment status to Shipped
* [Get shipping label](getShippingLabel.md) if auto shipping label is disabled at the facility and label is not already fetched.

### On SHIPMENT_SHIPPED:
* [createOrderShipmentInventoryIssuance](createOrderShipmentInventoryIssuance.md)
* Order Item is marked Completed
* Update Shopify order Fulfilled

**Modify contents of the Shipment after it is already SHIPMENT_APPROVED or SHIPMENT_PACKED.**
Why does the shipment have to be moved out of "approved" status to edit it's contents? For example fulfillment team may want to reject an item after begining pack pick process, in which case shipment will already be packed.

-   To pack a Shipment, we need shipping label. To give shipping label, shipping carrier need to know the package dimensions and weight.
-   Approving the shipment means communicates that the shipment is now ready for packing, and package type and weight are now final.


1. If the Approved shipment should be edited, The Shipment is first [reinitializeShipment](reinitializeShipment.md).To avoid error, the reinitialize process calls [voidShipmentLabel](voidShipmentLabel.md).
2. In case the Packed shipment should be edited, first [reinitializeShipment](reinitializeShipment.md). It moves shipment from SHIPMENT_PACKED status to SHIPMENT_INPUT, ensure to [voidShipmentPackageLabel](voidShipmentPackageLabel.md). Recompute the [ShipmentPackageWeight](calcShipmentPackageTotalWeight.md).

```
    <!-- ShipmentRouteSegment CarrierService status -->
    <StatusType description="ShipmentRouteSegment:CarrierService" hasTable="N"  statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusItem description="Not Started" sequenceId="01" statusCode="NOT_STARTED" statusId="SHRSCS_NOT_STARTED" statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusItem description="Confirmed" sequenceId="02" statusCode="CONFIRMED" statusId="SHRSCS_CONFIRMED" statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusItem description="Accepted" sequenceId="03" statusCode="ACCEPTED" statusId="SHRSCS_ACCEPTED" statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusItem description="Voided" sequenceId="08" statusCode="VOIDED" statusId="SHRSCS_VOIDED" statusTypeId="SHPRTSG_CS_STATUS"/>
    <StatusValidChange statusId="SHRSCS_NOT_STARTED" statusIdTo="SHRSCS_CONFIRMED" transitionName="Confirm"/>
    <StatusValidChange statusId="SHRSCS_CONFIRMED" statusIdTo="SHRSCS_ACCEPTED" transitionName="Accept"/>
    <StatusValidChange statusId="SHRSCS_CONFIRMED" statusIdTo="SHRSCS_VOIDED" transitionName="Void"/>
    <StatusValidChange statusId="SHRSCS_ACCEPTED" statusIdTo="SHRSCS_VOIDED" transitionName="Void"/>
```

### [Setting up a New Shipping Carrier](https://github.com/saastechacademy/foundation/blob/main/ofbiz-framework/intermediate/setupShippingCarrier.md)

### Pre-Requisits, NOT included in Fulfillment App. 
1) Setup Facility with Locations
2) Setup Product and Inventory configurations
3) Import product inventory
4) Import Orders 
5) Setup Fulfillment user roles and responsibilities.
6) Each Facility has list of Shipping Carriers and may be billing accounts with carrier. 

### Fulfillment App
1) PickList and Picking
2) Shipment lifecycle
   * Outgoing Shipment
   * Incoming Shipment
3) Shipping Gateway configuration
4) Inventory physical cycle count


***Shipping Gateway configuration***
1) [Shipping Carrier](/ofbiz-framework/intermediate/setupShippingCarrier.md)


## UAT

### List of scenarios to test createOrderFulfillmentWave
*   PickList is created, the list of assigned Pickers reconciles with the request
*   The number of unique shipGroupSeqId reconciles with the number of Shipments created.
*   The number records for each orderId and ShipmentId combination in OrderShipment table reconciles with ShipmentItems

### Ships together scenario
### Digital Goods shipment
### Physical Gift card shipment
### Marketing material and bonus material

### Scenarios 
*   Update shipTo Postal address after shipment is created. The shipping address should be first updated on OrderItemShipGroup and then update the address on Shipment.
  * Update contactMechId on OrderItemShipGroup
  * Update destinationContactMechId on Shipment
  * Update destContactMechId on ShipmentRouteSegment
*   Update shipTo Telecom number after shipment is created. The shipping Telecom should be first updated on OrderItemShipGroup and then update the Telecom on Shipment.
  * Update telecomContactMechId on OrderItemShipGroup
  * Update destinationTelecomNumberId on Shipment
  * Update destTelecomNumberId on ShipmentRouteSegment

## Questions 
1.  Why do we reset carrierPartyId and shipmentMethodTypeId on reinitializeShipment method? Both these fields are HC custom.
2.  What if OrderItemShipGrp has shipment carrier partyId and shipment method set, Do we rate shop or not? What business scenarios are related to this? 
3.  What if during Shipment processing, we may have to get ShippingLabel. In this case we can skip the rate shopping step, Read carrrier Party and shipmentMethodTypeId from the ShipmentRouteSegment entity.
4.  Are we honoring the shipmentMethodType suggested by brokering engine? Brokering engine evaluates distance between fulfillment location and deliver location, if the distance is within the range of ZONE 2, Brokering engine suggests ShipmentMethodType. The Rate shopping process should include the suggested shipmentMethodType.

## [Inventory Management](inventoryManagementProcess.md)

## Transfer Order

The advice for moving inventory from one storage facility to other. It helps manage the workflow. 
The TO is an OrderType like SalesOrder and PurchaseOrder. 
The API to [createTransferOrder](../oms/createTransferOrder.md) builds on the [createOrder](../oms/createOrder.md)
An inventory storage location may receive [InTransferShipment](createInTransferShipment.md) or ship [OutTransferShipment](createOutTransferShipment.md) for a transfer order.

## Receive Shipment

**Shipment Receiver briefly reviews incoming shipment.**
* If shipment received is a return (has RMA# or Return ID), 
* If shipment received is for a purchase order (has PO#), Shipment Receiver finds the PO corresponding to the items received and records PO receipt (inventory) quantity.
* If shipment received is for a ASN, shipment receiver finds the Shipment.

**Shipment Receiver reviews incoming items. and Shipment Receiver will receive the shipment even if**
* Shipment Receiver records a higher quantity received than was ordered, inventory reconciliation will report it.
* The product is a different color than what is in the system, Shipment Receiver will received it. inventory reconciliation will report it.
* The product that arrives is not the product on the PO or already been received.
